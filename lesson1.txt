How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

It made it faster to identify the changes 

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

Saves time and be more efficient, not waste time checking hundreds of line of code

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros: You can logically commit ad intervals that make sense, like after adding a function or fixing an error. Cons: If you forget to commit or make a note of it you could become confused and frustrated.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Its really great to see the process of the project and compare the different versions within each file instantaneously. 

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log shows you all commits for a project and get diff will allow you to pick 2 commits and compare the versions line by line

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    You can go back to the code prior to the error and revert back to the working code and try agaiN!

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
